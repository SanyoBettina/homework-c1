    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>
        Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. 
        They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.
        There are different studies that suggest that this happened between 15.000 and 100.000 years before our time. 
        The dingo is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live independently of humans in the range where they occur (parts of Australia).
    </p>
    <p>
        oday, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work.
         They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. 
         Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets. Dogs eat both meat and vegetables, 
         often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, 
         assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are sometimes called "canines" from the Latin word for dog - canis.
        Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other canids, such as wolves. 
        A baby dog is called a pup or puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old
    </p>
    <p>
        Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal
        and like being around humans. Dogs like to be petted, but only when they can first see the petter's hand before
        petting; one should never pet a dog from behind.

    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p>
        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated species 
        in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the .
        A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
        Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
        About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
        sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 
        Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. 
        A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
        such as those made by mice and other small mammals.
        [7] Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.
    </p>
    <p>
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.
        Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. 
        Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide,
        contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.

    <h2>Monkeys</h2>
    <p>
        Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes,
        also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys 
        except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, 
        apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. 
        Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense;
        Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes).
    </p>
    <p>
        any monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, 
        such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). 
        Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.
